# nannou-universe

A nannou sketch I made live at [GitHub Universe 2020](https://githubuniverse.com/Nannou-creative-coding-with-Rust/).

# Spoiler Alert

If you checkout this repository and run it, you'll get the _final_ result, not the step-by-step progression that I go through the talk.

# Follow along the talk

If you want to follow along the talk from scratch, you must install a few things first:

- rust of course! Follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- create a new binary project somewhere using `cargo new --bin universe`
- in the `universe` directory, add `nannou` as a dependency to your project by adding the line `nannou = "0.15"` after the `dependencies` entry in the `Cargo.toml` file
- Copy the [template](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/blob/master/examples/templates/template_app.rs) to your `src/main.rs` file
- Compile once the application using `cargo run --release`

You should be able to then just reproduce what I do in the video.

The repository here just gives you the final result, feel free to play around and ping me with your results!
